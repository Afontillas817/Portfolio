    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will retrieve and extract data from two different datasets, assess it, clean it, and use it to answer my research questions.\n",
    "This project will focus on Yelp data about businesses in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset contains information from Yelp's Open Dataset, a subset of Yelp's data. The Yelp Open Dataset is provided by Yelp as an all-purpose dataset for individuals to learn from. I downloaded this dataset manually and utilized the json file regarding businesses' check-in information. The variables in this dataset are `business_id` and `date`. Each value in the `date` column contains all of the dates and times that a user checked-in at a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the Yelp Fusion API to gather the second dataset. I submitted an application on Yelp's Developers website where I was granted a client ID and an API key to access the Yelp Fusion API. The second dataset focuses on the different attributes of each `business_id` from the first dataset. The variables for the second dataset are `business_id`, `name`, `rating`, `review_count`, `category`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these 2 datasets, I sought to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the average rating of businesses based on their amount of reviews and how are these 2 variables related?\n",
    "- What is the average rating of businesses based on their amount check-ins and how are these 2 variables related?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between Yelp user interactions (check-ins + reviews) and the rating given to a business?\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially considered focusing on businesses with the highest ratings, but I realized that metric can be unreliable. Multiple businesses have a 5-star review on yelp and a low count of reviews (<15 reviews) and check-ins, so querying for business data based on rating wouldn't necessarily gather businesses with a lot of user interactions."

    "The first dataset contains business check-in information from Yelp's Open Dataset. I obtained this json file by downloading it manually from Yelp's online Open Dataset. I chose this dataset to acquire the check-in information of different businesses. After I've assessed and cleaned this data, I will analyze the relationship between the amount of check-ins and a business' rating. The variables in this current dataset are `business_id` and `date`. As you can see, some businesses have more dates than others. This is because Yelp's Open Dataset stores check-ins by storing the date of each check-in rather than the number of check-ins. \n",

    "The total amount of check-ins is almost 3 times the total amount of reviews.\n",
    "A reason for this may be because submitting a check-in for a business on Yelp tends to be much less time-consuming than posting a Yelp review. Yelp users can easily submit a check-in without typing any words, whereas posting a review requires the user to type at least 85 characters in their review.\n",

    "Initially, I thought that businesses with more check-ins would have a slight tendency to rate higher than businesses with less check-ins. The analysis showed that is not the case. Amount of check-ins is not a notable factor for predicting the rating of a business."

I chose to explore this relationship because I was curious to see how a Yelp user's opinion of a business affected their interactions with a business' page on Yelp and vice-versa. "

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Prior to conducting my analysis, I speculated that businesses with more reviews or check-ins had a higher probability of having a higher rating than businesses with less reviews or check-ins. I expected that Yelp businesses that have established a decent rating (3.5-5.0) would attract more customers, increasing their amount of Yelp user reviews and check-ins. I also expected that Yelp businesses with a lot of Yelp user interactions would gain more popularity and traction, causing an increase of hype and customers. While this may be true in some cases, my analyses demonstrated that this is not the case for the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis in question 1 revealed that some businesses have a higher `mean_rating` than other businesses despite having a lower average amount of reviews. There were also businesses that had a lower `mean_rating` with a higher average amount of reviews compared to other businesses. This findings indicate that there is no significant relationship between review count and business rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis in question 2 revealed that businesses with a higher amount of check-ins do not have a higher probability of having a higher rating. `index_group 320-359` has a `mean_checkin` of 2501.100 and has the highest `mean_rating` at 4.088. I suppose this can be explained by a multitude of factors. One explanation may be that checking into a Yelp business is a lot less time-consuming and less effort than writing a review for a business. Because it's less time-consuming, many people check into a business regardless of whether they have a positive or a negative opinion about the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm somewhat surprised that `total_interaction` does not have a notable influence on business `rating` and vice-versa. My analysis for question 3 illustrated the lack of relationship between business `rating` and `total_interaction`. In conclusion, the quantity of Yelp reviews and check-ins are not reliable factors in predicting a business' rating. These 3 variables are not statistically related.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Numbers were rounded to the nearest thousandths.*"

    "### Reflection\n",
    "I would be interested in exploring the relationship between business `rating` and `total_interaction` based on different states or major metropolitan areas. I'm curious to see if the correlation between the 2 variables differ based on location or regional culture. I would also be interested in working with a dataset made from machine learning that predicts whether Yelp users' reviews are negative or positive."
